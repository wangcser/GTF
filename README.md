# GTF
## Introduction

A General Token Framework for tokens in blockchain.

you can develop token contract easily with the help of GTF. 

## Design Propose

With the reference of industry instance such as BNB, cryptoKitties, â€¦ , we learn and analysis all token EIPs in ethereum.

In our study, we have proposed a hierarchical token model for tokens in blockchain.

For a better understanding of this model, we designed this general token framework for going through the mainline and will designed many modules to support the core module.

## Dev Envs

We choose ethereum blockchain as our first test bed, our tool chain as follows:

- truffle + ganache
- contract with solidity
- test with javascript

## Work Flow

## Version Control

- 0.0.x: project start-up 
  - design modules and API
- 0.1.x: go though the mainline
  - finish the token core module
  - finish the unit test
- 0.2.x: go though the branches
  - finish the branches modules
  - finish the function test
- 0.3.x: tune the system
  - system debug
  - finish the system test
- 0.4.x: document stage
  - finish the error handing
  - finish GTF docs and manuals
